# README

This project demonstrates the use of Turbo Streams to deliver real-time updates without requiring Javascript or channels to be set up.

It was created as an experimental alternative to the typical long-form method of setting up channels and controllers used for the messaging app created in the [The Odin Project Websockets and Actioncable lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-websockets-and-actioncable).

See the project which follows the original curriculum [here](https://github.com/kevintsander/odin-messages).
